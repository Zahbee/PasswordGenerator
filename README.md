# PasswordGenerator
A basic password generator built using Java Swing. It allows users to choose the password length and select character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters). The app generates a random password based on these settings and includes a button to copy the password to the clipboard. Simple UI, easy to use.
